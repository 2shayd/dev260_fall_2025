PART A PROCESS:

I started by thoroughly reading the assignment instructions.
Created files and organized file structure according to instruction
Combined the provided project files with my own
Read over all documentation
Run the project
Began with step 1. Since it was already completed, this was me studying the code and how it works
Step 2 was the same as step 1. Structure was there so I just needed to understand it
Step 3 I viewed the TODO list and read through the recommended website link
Tried to run after completing step 3A but realized I needed to do steps 3A-C
Ran program and debugged as needed to successfully complete step 3
Worked through all following steps, testing for success in between each before moving on

PART A TEST:

=== PERFORMANCE TEST ===

Testing performance of various operations...

Testing 10,000 insertions at end:
Time: 0ms
Search for middle element: 756084 ticks
Remove first: 163459 ticks
Remove last: 152250 ticks
Final list size: 9998

PART B PROCESS:

Read assignment instructions
Run project
Study provided code
tested program at end of steps and debugged as needed
much easier to finish than the previous, but likely because i knew what to do now and could implement previously made methods

Performance Reflection:

I would use DLL for:
-insert/delete at arbitrary positions
-traversal using next and previous for both directions
-dynamic sizing without pre-allocation

I would not use DLL for:
-Random access is required frequently because arrays or lists are faster performance wise
-memory overhead is a concern since the next and previous references on each node use more memory than an arry or sll
